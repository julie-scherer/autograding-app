2. **Logical Structure**: Does the student's solution logically follow the assignment instructions? Provide feedback on the overall structure and coherence of their approach.
3. **Readability**: Assess the readability of the code. Consider the use of meaningful variable names, inclusion of comments explaining the thought process, and overall formatting for readability.
4. **Robustness and Error Handling**: Evaluate how well the code handles edge cases, invalid inputs, and potential errors.
5. **Modularity and Reusability**: Assess whether the code is structured in a way that makes it easy to understand and reuse specific components.

Please ensure your feedback is positive, focused, and constructive, offering specific suggestions for improvement where necessary.
