## Task: Provide a Grade

### Instructions

Evaluate the student's homework submission in the following four areas: `Query Conversion`, `PySpark Jobs`, `Unit Tests`, and `Code Quality`. Assign a rating of **Proficient**, **Satisfactory**, **Needs Improvement**, or **Unsatisfactory** for each area. A passing grade requires at least "Satisfactory" in the first three areas and at least "Needs Improvement" in `Code Quality`.

### Grading Rubric

**Proficient**
1. **Query Conversion**: Flawless conversion of both queries to SparkSQL. Strong understanding of TrinoSQL and SparkSQL query languages.
2. **PySpark Jobs**: Well-structured and error-free. Demonstrates robust Spark capabilities.
3. **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests covering positive, negative, boundary, and edge cases. Ensures code's integrity.
4. **Code Quality**: Well-organized and fully documented. Follows best practices in modularization, resource use, error handling, and maintainability. Easily readable.

**Satisfactory**
1. **Query Conversion**: Accurate conversion of both queries with minor correctable errors. Retains original functionalities.
2. **PySpark Jobs**: Executes without errors. Minor issues present but do not affect core functionality.
3. **Unit Tests**: Basic tests for both jobs, covering main functionalities. Might miss some minor scenarios but none that critically affect the code's integrity.
4. **Code Quality**: Well-organized and mostly documented. Minor inconsistencies in style.

**Needs Improvement**
1. **Query Conversion**: Significant mistakes or only one query converted. Errors affecting logic or output.
2. **PySpark Jobs**: Major logical flaws compromising functionality or only one job created.
3. **Unit Tests**: Tests only for one job or tests overlook significant issues and potential edge cases.
4. **Code Quality**: Lacks adequate documentation and has inconsistent style. Somewhat organized.

**Unsatisfactory**
1. **Query Conversion**: No queries converted.
2. **PySpark Jobs**: No PySpark jobs created.
3. **Unit Tests**: No tests created.
4. **Code Quality**: Unorganized and undocumented. Does not follow any recognizable conventions.

### Final Grade

Based on the evaluations above, recommend a final grade and a brief summary of the assessment.
